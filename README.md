# Urban Sound Classification with Neural Networks
The aim of the project is to create a Neural Network which is able to classify urban sound contained in UrbanSound8K dataset. Three different Neural Network architecture was developed with three different features extracted from audio files (MFCCs, Mel-Spectogram and Chromagram) as input.
