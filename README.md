# Urban Sound Classification with Neural Networks
The aim of the project is to create a Neural Network which is able to classify urban sound contained in UrbanSound8K dataset. Three different Neural Network architecture was developed with three different features extracted from audio files (MFCCs, Mel-Spectogram and Chromagram) as input.

### Dataset
[UrbanSound8K](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html) : contains 8732 labeled sound excerpts (â‰¤4 sec) of urban sounds from 10 different classes.

### Extracted features:
- MFFCs
- Mel-spectogram
- Chromagram

### Classification models
Three different architectures of FNN with different numbers of hidden layers and neurons.
